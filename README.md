# Mid-360 Driver

This is an implementation of the Mid-360 driver, intended to serve as a replacement for [livox_ros_driver2](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver2).

It has the following features:

- It does not rely on Livox-SDK2 but directly implements UDP communication, making it highly lightweight.

- It supports automatically obtaining the LiDAR IP, eliminating the need to configure the LiDAR IP.

- It supports multiple LiDARs.

- When time synchronization is not enabled, it calculates the time difference only once upon the first received message and uses this difference thereafter, ensuring basic time synchronization.

Special note:

- It publishes point clouds in the PointCloud2 format, which differs from the point cloud format of livox_ros_driver2. Users may need to modify code in other packages.
